# Big Data Management - Project 1 

Student project developed with 	[@KatBCN](https://github.com/KatBCN) for the Big Data Management course of the Data Science Master's at [UPC](https://github.com/UPC). 

The goal of the project was to create a distributed filesystem destined to host the Landing Zone of a DataOps pipeline. We decided to build it using HDFS and structuring our files using Parquet. We built it in a remote server running Ubuntu 18.04. The overall architecture of the project is illustrated in the diagram below.
